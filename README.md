# ToothTalk
A simple single screen Bluetooth chat app developed in Kotlin.
Simply clone or download the zip file. Extract it and import the project in your android studio.
You will require two android devices to test the app.

Things to setup before using the app:
First make sure the two devices are already paired with each other.
Then click on Listen button of the App on one device and on the other device click on List devices button and select the required 
device from the list view.
If the status is shown connected, you are good to go.
Now you can send and receive messages using the Send button.

I have tried to explain the whole code using comments in the MainActivity.kt file itself. Go through it once. It'll be fun.
